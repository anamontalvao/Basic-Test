##Project ID 5183
### Basic JEST Challenge

This project is to test a board and a div functions.

The code is written in Javascript
The tests are running in jest
To write the code I used WebStorm

#The process
The first thing to do is to check if the project is properly configured and running by executing the "sum" test - this test should pass.
The second thing is to read and review the code to understand what the project is doing and if it has a valid logic.
For the "div.js" tests, the logic was to perform a test for each set of real numbers and verify if the result matches the expected results. This includes checking if the handling of division by zero is correctly done by the language.
For the "board.js" tests, the idea was to create a test for each function (create, remove, and get). However, it was found that the "remove" function is not working because "boards" is not properly declared.
It is not clear in the code if the dimensions of the board should follow any kind of validation (accept only integers or numbers).


#To run:
